# Genomic-Signal-Neural-Network-Research
Created and implemented neural networks using PyTorch to predict locations of structural variants between sequenced genomes of individuals and reference genomes to determine relatedness between individuals (like parent and offspring) and improve the signal reconstruction of low quality data.
